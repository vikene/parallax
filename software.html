	<em><u>Event Description:</u></em><br><br>
	Agnes is in her middle school now and  is a required to submit a project  after her summer holidays and has totally forgotten about it. She cries to Gru at the last minute and tells that she won't go to school. Unfortunately Dr.Nefario , Gru's  gadget  is very sick to help them at the moment.  Even her sisters don't know what to do about it. All that Margo could come up with is, "Okay.. Everything is going to be fine". Gru tries to persuade her and fails miserably making her wail at the top of her lungs.  Without any further ado Gru calls the minions, "Tim Mark and Phil , help the girl find what she wants"
These rambunctious bunch of minions are clueless yet determined to help  Gru. For they are fiercely loyal to him at the same time they know that it is the only way to stop Agnes cry. They come up with various ideas but have no clue how to code them. Can you help these little minions to convert their ideas into codes?  Finally will they be able to shout, "Minions saved the day" ?<br><br>
