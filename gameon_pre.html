'Anubhava', a Sanskrit word, denotation of gain of certitude knowledge from experience, brings us this year a platform for appreciation of intellectual excellence and creativity. It is the annual intra-college technical festival organized by the students of ECE for the School of EEE. Tech fest has diversified into an organisation that apart from showcasing the pinnacle of technical advancement, also strives for the betterment of the society with unique initiatives. We aim to nurture the ideas that come forth in the spirit of healthy competition. To accomplish the same, we intend to create opportunities such as collaboration among students and the respected sublime faculty members, guidance to materialize such idea.We aspire to explore the unexplored. To develop human potential to its fullest extent so that intellectually capable and imaginatively gifted leaders can emerge in a range of professions. By conducting this plethora of events, a student's talent and the ability for a team work is more pronounced. This fest would bring about the breadth of understanding of innovations, flexing its muscles in the areas of the student's interest. And we do it in a more fun way, in a minion way. Anubhava would mean an apt way of coming-into-existence through experience cause "developing today's engineers is pioneering tomorrow's technology". </h3>
