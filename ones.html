<em><u>Event Description:</u></em><br><br>
We have seen many interesting competitions between cars, bots etc but we never came across a competition between minions so here in ANUBHAVA'14 we will have a war between yellow minions and the mutated minions (purple). Consider yellow minions as ones and mutated minions as zeroes, the task here is simple, find out which minion has the upper hand over the other minions based on the knowledge on digital electronics.
<br><br>
<em><u>Round 1:</u></em><br>
                 This round consists of multiple choice questions. The participants are tested on their knowledge of basics in digital electronics .This is a complete paper and pen round.<br><br>

<em><u>Round 2:</u></em><br>
             This round consists of questions purely based on Digital electronics in which the answers will be completely binary (1's & 0's). The participants are required to find out who wins based on the result. This is also a complete paper and pen round.<br><br>

<em><u>Round 3:</u></em><br>
                Participants are required to design and implement a circuit based on the problem statement given by the organizers .This should be done on spot and time plays a crucial role.<br><br>
